# Description of project
This project of interactive photo gallery. The gallery displays multiple images, each with an overlay containing a heading, description, and a button or link for view more images related to its . Also the gallery is responsive and provides specific interactions like scaling images on hover and displaying an overlay.

# explanations of my approach to the project 
- Frist of all i start with creating github repository called "CoA_Challenges" then i have clone the my repository to my local directory with in that directory is where i created files and folder needed to perform all my tasks.

- So i start to write code making the HTML structure contains a div container with multiple image cards. Each card has an image and an overlay with text and a button.

-Additionally, I defines the layout and interactive features for the photo gallery. It includes styles for the image container, cards, overlays, and responsive design.

- Then after i worked on two coding tasks which are finding a contiguous subarray with a target sum and transforming a string based on its length.
